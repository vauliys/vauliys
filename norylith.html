                    <p>Neyomi is the child of Arien Ainsley and Esther Noru. She resides with her father in their
                        home
                        and tailor shop “The Seam Beneath”, located on the outskirts of <a class="highlight" href="">The Spindle</a>, the heart of
                        Norylith. She grew up not knowing her mother who died during childbirth.
                    </p>
                    <p>While Neyomi was told her mother died during childbirth, only her father and a dead delivery
                        nurse know the truth. That the same woman who has a seat on the Council of Nine, Head of
                        Instructors: the Educators of Norylith, is Neyomi’s mother. Her birth sworn to secrecy as it is
                        against
                        society law for governors to bare children to prevent family succession. With the help of
                        Arien’s tailoring and her small frame, Ester manages to hide her pregnancy. Following the
                        birth
                        of Neyomi, Esther not wishing to risk her daughters life, cuts of all contact to Arien and
                        their
                        daughter. She rules as the cold Head Instructor, protecting the word of Norylith and it’s
                        history.
                    </p>
                    <p>As Neyomi grew up, she adopted a stray Calico white and brown cat named "Cappuccino".
                        <a href="#wiki-neyomi-1" class="highlight caption">[1]</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>Neyomi has always had an interest in sewing thanks to her father. She would spend every
                        waking
                        moment with him downstairs in the shop, watching him drape fabric and measure his customers.
                        As
                        she grew older, she became her own little seamstress sewing her own clothes. On her
                        fourteenth
                        birthday, her father had a surprise that required venturing further into The Spindle, he
                        purchased Velanite sewing needles, light as a feather and found only near the Seamlines that
                        run
                        deep underground powering Norylith. Finely engraved in cursive,“You’re my favourite thread,
                        Pa.”
                        could be found on each individual needle. Following the devouring of sweet baked goods and a
                        “Happy Birthday” from her father, Neyomi and anyone in The Spindle was caught in an
                        explosion.
                    </p>
                    <p>The explosion left her father wheel-chair bound, with Velanite shrapnel burried deep in his
                        spine
                        with no way of removing it as it would kill him. Neyomi suffered cuts and lacerations all
                        over
                        her body,mostly healed by the Curators: the medwards of Norylith. However, the most damage
                        was
                        inflicted on her forearms and wrists that left permanent scaring. It took her months for her
                        to
                        regain full control of her wrists but even after almost a decade, her wrists are weak and
                        ache
                        with the simpliest of movements. Her dreams haunted by a red sky, and fire devouring her.

                    <h5>Appearance</h5>
                    <p>Neyomi has pale rosy skin with beauty spots, long and straight dark blue-black hair that is
                        said
                        to be reminiscent of a waterfall paired with blue eyes with amber flecks. Flat and short
                        brows,
                        a flat nose bridge, short thin lips, round cheeks and arched ears. She has a tall, slender
                        figure and is said to be graceful and beautiful. She has several fine-line scars on both
                        palms
                        of her hands that travel up along her forearms. </p>

                    <p>She wears a dangling gold bar on her right ear that connects to a hoop on her helix via a
                        thin
                        chain. She wears a dark navy large brim hat, high waisted wide emerald green tailored
                        paints,
                        white boots with an orange sole, a white blouse with orange floral print bishop sleeves that
                        hit
                        the elbows and a tall standing collar that drops into a sweetheart neckline with a plain
                        white
                        bodice. </p>

                    <h5>Personality</h5>
                    <p>Neyomi is kind, warm and naturally friendly. She carries a deep sense of responsibility,
                        always
                        caring for her father and worrying about him. She's a loyal, law-abiding citizen, creative
                        and
                        smart with a quick sense of humour.</p>
                    <p>Neyomi often takes on too much at once, bottling up her own feelings while putting others
                        first.
                        She refuses to utter a word about the explosion and has yet to control her fear of fire. She
                        tends to leap into things without fully thinking them through, always wanting to help. But
                        when
                        she's sewing, she's slows down and embraces the slowness,losing herself thread by thread and
                        letting her emotions out through every stitch. It's the one place where her heart can speak
                        freely, where memories of her father's now rare laughter and the scent of fresh linen wrap
                        around her like second skin. Sewing is her stillness in a world that asks her to be constant
                        sunlight.</p>
                    <p>Though she's light-hearted on the face, Neyomi is very controlled beneath, she fears losing
                        herself to anger or fear. Being everyone's "sun" is exhausting somethings, but she rarely
                        lets
                        it show. She's like a waterfall: steady, strong and beautiful. But there's a quiet force
                        beneath
                        her constant flow.</p>
